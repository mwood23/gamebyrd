But in the early days of video games, most of them featured the same idea repeated in multiple levels of increasing difficulty with the real goal being getting the highest score possible before dying. Does that make some of these game repetitive? On the contrary, some of them are highly addictive, as Asteroids for the Atari 2600 proves.\n\nThe premise of the game is very simple - you are in a ship in space that has been surrounded by giant asteroids. You have to blast them all out of the sky before they run into your ship. Each level starts with a bunch of large asteroids. When you hit those, you get two medium size asteroids. Hitting those turns them into one small asteroid that disappears when you hit it.\n\nAs you can well imagine, those when the asteroids start multiplying, it can get chaotic quickly. While you only start with four big asteroids in the first level, every one after that starts with nine. --Mark Baker","received_by":"admin","comments":""},{"title":"Donkey Kong","rating":79,"console":"Atari 2600","cover":"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLOz9Yl8fo00JDZR43V6acmpsf9ncH1b_kNJDbW4v36Rc0-nOI","quantity":10,"quantity_sold":4,"price":7,"description":"Donkey Kong is an arcade game released by Nintendo in 1981.

Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.","received_by":"admin","comments":""},{"title":"Luigi's Mansion","rating":99,"console":"GameCube","cover":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sm9T0oDQL.jpg","quantity":6,"quantity_sold":7,"price":12,"description":"While it won't win many points for originality, Luigi's Mansion is great fun to play, and it's a perfect showcase for the GameCube's graphics horsepower. In the game, Luigi--Mario's younger brother and costar of several games through the years--has inherited a spooky old mansion provided he can summon the courage to spend the night within its haunted walls. Luigi arrives prepared to clean house using a Ghostbusters-like device that stuns the ghosts with light and then vacuums them up safely. The gameplay gets tricky when some of the bigger light-shy ghosts vanish before you can put the Hoover on them. And, should one of the spectral pests sneak up on Luigi, he loses courage and the common currency of all Mario-inspired games: gold coins. Graphically, the game is amazing for its translucent ghosts, mirrored images, and particle effects (Luigi's vacuum device will also suck the dust off a chair and the mist out of a freezer). The game's campy visuals are more cute than spooky, so even jittery Mario fans will love this one. --Porter B.

A large part of the fun is figuring out the order in which to beat the bosses. This also allows you to up the difficulty level if you want an extra challenge, as each of the boss's weapons work against another specific boss.

Picking up a few months after the events of the first game, RE2 sees the entire town of Raccoon City hit with the devastating virus that zombified only a few dozen folks in the original Resident Evil. It's up to rookie cop Leon Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, sister of one of the main RE characters, to save not only themselves but any and all survivors, to boot. The gameplay remains basically the same as before: As one of two characters, you solve puzzles and shoot monsters. The original Resident Evil featured two playable personas as well, although the differences between the two weren't incredibly significant. One could carry more items than the other could, while the other was easier to play, and they both had their own distinct storylines. In Resident Evil 2 the differences between the two are a bit more interesting. For example, Claire starts off with a lock pick, while Leon begins with a lighter, which alone changes the order in which the game's puzzles must be solved. Each character also finds different weapons along his or her quest. For instance, Claire will find a grenade launcher, however when playing as Leon, a shotgun will be in its place.","received_by":"admin","comments":""},{"title":"Pokemon Snap","rating":91,"console":"Nintendo 64","cover":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGP0N3V9L.jpg","quantity":7,"quantity_sold":3,"price":11,"description":"Although it's geared more for younger players, PokÃ©mon Snap is good clean fun for PokÃ©mon fans of any age.

He is easily Nintendo's greatest asset, and one of the most brilliant storytellers ever to work in the interactive medium. His latest effort, Star Fox 64, is a game designed in his tradition of greatness, and it's perhaps the best N64 game seen since Super Mario 64 - which is still considered by many as the best video game of all time.\nStar Fox 64, the sequel to the Super Nintendo title Star Fox, is a shooter in the truest sense. As happens in Star Fox's predecessors, you fly along and blast away your enemies while powering up your weapons. But Star Fox 64 adds quality gameplay twists that rival the game's incredible 3D graphics. These features include multiple gameplay paths (which take you through various levels depending on how well you play, including a Tomorrow Land-like city, a meteor-filled corner of space, and a post-apocalyptic battleground), a submarine and a tank level, a four-player battle mode, and the smoothest 3D flight control yet seen on a console system. Not only is the animation incredibly smooth, but every polygonal building and ship is finely detailed. The enemies are also quite varied - in fact, the final boss, Andross, even qualifies as menacingly scary (there's something terrifying about a huge ape that literally chews you up and spits you out).

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling have been left out of this release.\nStill, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, and Mario Kart 64 offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks. Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels. Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck speeds, if only for a moment.\n\nThe multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen. --Eric Twelker","received_by":"admin","comments":""},{"title":"Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask","rating":97,"console":"Nintendo 64","cover":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cBGTEKKGL.jpg","quantity":8,"quantity_sold":1,"price":14,"description":"Although most people disagree with me, I think this installment in the Zelda series is better than Ocarina of Time.

Framed for a crime they did not commit, the two must race against the clock in order to prevent the sale of the Syphon Filter virus to a terrorist nation. Played from a third-person point of view, the story takes gamers from the streets of Moscow to the Agency's secret Syphon Filter lab. Such a dangerous mission requires effective weapons and gadgets; naturally, the agency provides an arsenal of more than 25 enemy-stoppers, including a cross bow, a sniper rifle with a night-vision scope, tear gas, binoculars, and other goodies.

The ultimate goal is to beat your opponent to the finish line, but usually it's hard enough just dodging oncoming traffic, swerving around police roadblocks (complete with spike strips), and trying to keep pursuit vehicles from slamming you off the road.

This story focuses on Serge's quest for the Frozen Flame, which will give the beholder the power to bend space and time. Serge wants the power to save himself from dying in a parallel universe but, as you can guess, nefarious forces are also vying for the Frozen Flame to suit their own purposes.\nChrono Cross features the stylish character designs and wondrous cut scenes that gamers have come to expect from SquareSoft, but the game also has a number of gameplay innovations. Though the battle engine is essentially turn-based, characters don't have to wait their turn to cast a spell or make an attack; battles are moderated by stamina.

Perhaps the best comparison would be to say Driver is just like Destruction Derby in a city with cops, traffic, and mission-based gameplay. After all, the same company makes both games. But that wouldn't be fair either, because while Driver resembles a lot of games, it's really quite unique, and fun. You play the role of Tanner, a former racecar driver turned policeman. Thanks to your past driving experience, you are selected to go undercover as a wheelman for hire to investigate the Castaldi family, the underworld's most dangerous organization. Before you can go through the game's story mode you must complete an extreme driving test that is really hard. You are asked to complete various driving maneuvers, such as a 360, a reverse 180, a slalom course, and other advanced driving techniques that will greatly help you later in the game. Once you complete this test, you can start taking jobs. Just about all the various jobs consist of getting somewhere to pick someone or something up, or dropping someone or something off before the time limit expires. Some of the most enjoyable missions, however, are the ones in which you must ram a fleeing vehicle until it's disabled. To help you find your way through the vast cities, there is an onscreen map that shows you the location of your objective point and the streets that you can use to get there.

While that proved good news for Sony's coffers, it posed a tough challenge for its developers: How can the sequel surpass the original? For better or worse, Gran Turismo 2 has taken the Star Wars: Special Edition approach to tackling this challenge. The bulk of the game's top-notch graphics and gameplay remain true to the original, but this version is packed with extra add-ons - more tracks, more cars, more races and more secrets - that have turned the game into a mammoth two-disc experience. The sequel may not play or look noticeably better than the original, but it's certainly a bigger meal to digest. With that said, prospective buyers will fall into four categories: * Fans who loved the original Gran Turismo and have actually unlocked all the game's secrets: The purchase of this game is a no-brainer. * Fans who loved the original Gran Turismo but lacked the patience or skills to unlock all the game's secrets: The addition of an off-road rally racing mode won't be enough incentive to rehash a gameplay formula all too similar to the original, despite having more cars and tracks. This might not be your cup of tea. * Those who haven't played Gran Turismo but who love cars and seek a pure racing simulation: The purchase of this game is also a no-brainer, assuming you have a lot of free time ahead. * Casual video gamers looking for fun, easy racing entertainment (or for those shopping for a kids' gift): It's a toss-up.

Wipeout XL has six all-new tracks and two hidden bonus tracks. There are fifteen ships, seven more than the original game. Each ship's strengths and weaknesses appear right on screen: top speed, turning ability, shield level, energy level, thrust, and aerodynamics. Wipeout XL's turning has been fine tuned, making it much tighter, yielding superior control and \"road hugging.\" The weapons in the original Wipeout slowed the opponent down but yielded little satisfaction. In the sequel, it is possible to completely eliminate a weak opponent from the race. The earthquake weapon is unspeakably awesome. The graphics in Wipeout XL show the benefits of a year's efforts. The tracks are more detailed, with parrots flying through the lush vegetation of the South American track and monorails cruising along beside the hovercars. The background visuals are elaborate to the point of distraction. The weapons are visually spectacular, and seeing the light trails behind the hovercars is just plain cool. The sound effects are an improvement over those in the original, offering sonic details of everything from the laying of mines, to the explosion of a direct missile hit. The music soundtrack features a mix of techno and ambient house tracks that perfectly matches the pace of the game. The artificial intelligence has been tweaked up a few notches and will aggressively attempt to eliminate players right from the start.

Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins.

Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.\nStrategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate.

The game was notable for including the Super FX chip, which gave programmers the ability to create 3D objects with simple polygons.\n\nI booted up this game today, and it's still a blast to run through. Yes, it's very primitive 3D - you can count the individual polygons on each object - but the designs are creative and Nintendo found some commendable ways to make distinct, varied worlds with what they had. It always marvels to see the programming feats and innovations of the 16-bit era, and Star Fox is the pinnacle of that.\n\nMore importantly, the game plays well. A couple of the later FX Chip games suffered by pushing 3D at the cost of gameplay. The framerate in Star Fox does suffer a bit in the later levels when there's so much onscreen, but overall the game plays exactly like a fast-paced shooter should. You get your upgrades, barrel rolls, adjustable settings, multiple difficulty levels, and a few secrets to discover - not bad for a game that could've just cashed in based on its graphics. --Simon","received_by":"admin","comments":""},{"title":"Super Double Dragon","rating":90,"console":"Super Nintendo","cover":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/SNS-WD-USA.gif/250px-SNS-WD-USA.gif","quantity":7,"quantity_sold":7,"price":6,"description":"Super Double Dragon is the 4th double dragon game to headline a nintendo console, this time it was picked up again by tradewest for the publishing, the game is one of the best co-op fighting games ever to hit the SNES system yet a memorable game as well, but there is some downside about it, first the game can be hard for newcomers and missing the difficulty selection from it's Japanese counterpart another thing, which it's common in all of the double dragon games theres no health pick up so your character will take full damage unless you clear the level before losing a life, another con is with the weapons you still lose the weapon your holding when moving on to a new area of the level, now the good the combat has been improved with the new hardware capabilites the game uses all the buttons and it now has a seprate jump button and a new block move and during blocking you can catch an enemiy's arm and counter with a furry of punches and kicks or throw them to the enemy behind you, also the shoulder buttons are use to charge for additional attacks such as a spin back fist or spin kick then if the meter is half full you can do the cyclone kick, if the meter is full you go into a power mode which all your punches and kicks can knock the enemy down with one strike, in conclusion this is one the best Double Dragon games ever and i highly recommeded it if you own a SNES. --joshcobra89","received_by":"admin","comments":""},{"title":"NBA Jam","rating":85,"console":"Super Nintendo","cover":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nOnmOxOUL._SX385_.jpg","quantity":7,"quantity_sold":1,"price":14,"description":"This is the best NBA game on the SNES.
